      <description>The HTTP Strict Transport Security header (Strict-Transport-Security) allows you to tell the brower to only communicate with a site using HTTPS. Once the browser has successfully connected using HTTPS and seen the header, it will only communicate with the site using HTTPS from that point forward, changing the protocol if needed. By enabling this header you can prevent man-in-the-middle attacks via SSL stripping.
There is a good overview @ Mozilla on the header and its benefits.</description>

To enable you simply set the contentEditable attribute of an element to true:
// make the entire website editable document.body.contentEditable = true; // make an element editable document.getElementById(&#39;myDiv&#39;).contentEditable = true;  To check if an element is editable you check the isContentEditable attribute:</description>

      <description>I was after a query string builder to support a System.Net.HttpClient that I was building tonight and it was surprising hard to find something that met my needs.

public class QueryStringBuilder : NameValueCollection { public QueryStringBuilder() : base(StringComparer.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase) { } public QueryStringBuilder(NameValueCollection collection) : base(StringComparer.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase) { Add(collection); } public QueryStringBuilder(object items) : base(StringComparer.</description>
